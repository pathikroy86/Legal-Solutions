                            <p>Michael Oykhman is a very professional lawyer and the first time I spoke to him he asked
                                about my situation and he gave me some very helpful advice and assistance and also told
                                me his odds of winning this case. During the days I was in contact with micheal I could
                                feel the level of professionalism of him and his team, he is able to respond back to you
                                with any questions you have within 24 hours. In the end he was as successful in helping
                                me win my case as he had initially promised me.If you are still struggling to find a
                                lawyer, I highly recommend Michael Oykhman.</p>

                            <p>I had the pleasure of working and trusting my case with Joseph Beller. I had 2 counts
                                against me, and in the end, Joseph was able to present and use his “fighter skills” in
                                court to have my charges lowered to a conditional discharge. On top of this, this firm
                                follows its mission values statement by being ethical, transparent, available, and very
                                friendly. Joseph and his team treated me with the utmost respect from start to finish.
                                Thank you again, Joseph! I hope to never call you again </p>
